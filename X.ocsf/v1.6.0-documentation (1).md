### 2007 (Class 2007)

The Application Security Posture Finding event is a notification about any bug, defect, deficiency, exploit, vulnerability, weakness or any other issue with software and related systems. Application Security Posture Findings typically involve reporting on the greater context including compliance, impacted resources, remediation guidance, specific code defects, and/or vulnerability metadata. Application Security Posture Findings can be reported by Threat & Vulnerability Management (TVM) tools, Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tools, or other similar tools. Note:if the event producer is a security control, the <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and its <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into the <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note:</strong>If the Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the <code>incident</code> profile or aggregate this finding into an <code>Incident Finding</code>.

By using normalized time, observability tools can provide accurate, uniform measurements of operation performance and latency, regardless of where or when the events actually occur. |
| start_time_dt | [datetime_t](#types) | Optional | datetime | The start timestamp of the span, essential for identifying latency and performance bottlenecks. This timestamp is normalized across the observability system, ensuring consistency even when events occur across distributed services with potentially unsynchronized clocks.
